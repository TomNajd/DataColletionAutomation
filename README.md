# DataColletionAutomation
Statistics assignment in university required my team to collect daily fuel price data from a specified domain, Using a variety of python modules, I created a piece of code that web scrapes the required fuel price data, formats it, then inputs it into a excel file, thus automating majority of the assignment work.


used the module HTML session to initiate chrome driver to open to specific pages I was scraping. Used date time module to print date and time each time to code was run, also used pandas module to automate data input into excel file. Then used simple inbuild python slicing techniques to format the data.
